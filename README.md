## Key Points Addressed

### **Root Cause of Latency**
- High data volume in Kafka (Redpanda) causing broker bottlenecks.
- Slow consumers (e.g., SageMaker) struggling to process messages quickly enough.
- Infrastructure limitations like lack of auto-scaling.
- Inefficient data flow due to the absence of preprocessing.

## **System Designs**

### **1. Simplified System Design**
The simplified design focuses on optimizing the main pipeline for moderate workloads.

#### **Key Components**
- **Data Ingestion**:
  - Redpanda Cluster with three brokers collects and stores incoming data streams.
- **ML Processing**:
  - SageMaker contains:
    - A **Training Instance** for model development.
    - An **Inference Instance** for real-time predictions.
- **Monitoring**:
  - **Latency Monitor** tracks system performance.
  - **Alert System** sends notifications when performance issues arise.
- **Optimization Tools**:
  - **Load Balancer** distributes data evenly across resources.
  - **Auto-Scaling Group** dynamically adjusts resources based on demand.
  - **Cache Layer** speeds up data processing by storing frequently accessed data.

- **Mermaid Code (TXT)**: [Simplified Mermaid Code](V1 code-anisa ahmed.txt)

#### **Summary**
This version provides a straightforward, easy-to-implement design that optimizes the pipeline with load balancing, auto-scaling, and caching.

### **2. Detailed System Design**
The detailed design introduces robust tools to handle larger, more complex workloads.

#### **Key Components**
- **Data Ingestion**:
  - Redpanda Cluster includes six brokers for scalability.
  - **Data Preprocessor** cleans and filters data before ingestion.
- **ML Processing**:
  - SageMaker remains the same but benefits from upstream optimizations.
- **Monitoring**:
  - **Monitoring Dashboard** displays detailed metrics.
  - A second **Alert System** ensures redundancy.
- **Optimization Tools**:
  - **Stream Processor**: Transforms data in real-time for SageMaker.
  - **Kafka MirrorMaker**: Replicates data to another Kafka cluster for redundancy.
  - Additional **Load Balancers** and **Cache Layers** improve scalability and reduce latency.

#### **Files**
- **Diagram (PDF)**: [Detailed Diagram](V2 diagram-anisa ahmed.pdf)
- **Mermaid Code (TXT)**: [Detailed Mermaid Code](V2 code-anisa ahmed.txt)

#### **Summary**
This version is designed for large-scale systems, ensuring redundancy, real-time optimization, and fault tolerance.
